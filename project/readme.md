# Project

For your class project you should combine Google Cloud and the M5Stack IoT devices to create a full application. 
Think of something that you always wanted to do, and then try it to do during the class project! This could be your big startup idea!

Your project is expected to have some machine learning component or analytics (eg Google AutoML, recommendations, etc), some data component (eg Google BigQuery, Google IoT), and use the M5stack devices with some [sensors](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-sensor). We have many sensors (presence, distance, light, etc) which you can borrow during the semester (and be responsible for it!). If you need a sensor that we don't already have, you can ask for it, same if you need more m5stack devices for your project. 


## Deliverables

- The YouTube URL (private is fine) of a video describing your approach (problem + your solution + a demo).
- An article for the general public (ie describe the problem on a high level) which you will post in LinkedIn, and include also your video in it.
- A git repo with your code, and a readme describing how to deploy it (don't include any passwords or secret keys!).

## Ideas of what to do

1. Weather monitoring systems, detecting anomalies and pushing alerts.
2. A cashier application that scans barcodes of products and does recommendations.
3. A home video surveillance system.
4. A remote energy monitoring application for your house, RV, boat etc.
5. (your idea here).

There needs to be an interface either in the browser (via Google Cloud/Run) or using the M5Stack devices, so that someone can test your application.

## Deadlines

1. March 09: send your 1-page proposal to your TAs for approval. You should clearly write down how many sensors, devices, etc you will need for your project, and also which services from Google Cloud you expect to use. Your TAs may add more elements to your project to make it more challenging!
2. March 30: Milestone 1: Show your progress during the lab.
3. May 04: Milestone 2: Show your progress. 
4. May 30: Final deliverable (LinkedIn article, video, github, and web address if your application is live)
