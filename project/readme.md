# Project

For your class project you will combine Google Cloud and the M5Stack IoT devices to create a full application. 
Think of something that you always wanted to do, and then try it to do during the class project! This could be your big startup idea! Try to find something that you are passionate about.

Your project is expected to have some machine learning component or analytics (eg Google AutoML, recommendations, etc), some data component (eg Google BigQuery, Google IoT), and must use an M5stack device, possibly with some [sensors](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-sensor). We have many sensors (presence, distance, light, etc) which you can borrow during the semester (and be responsible for it!). If you need a sensor that we don't already have, you can ask for it, same if you need more m5stack devices for your project. 

For your project you can use the M5stack IoT device as a visualization device (see what is happening in the world) and/or for interacting or initiating actions to your backend.


## Deliverables

- The YouTube URL (unlisted or public) of a video describing your approach (problem + your solution + a demo).
- An article for the general public (i.e. describe the problem on a high level) which you are expected to post in LinkedIn, and include also your video in it. This is expected to be small, 1-2 paragraphs, and include a photo and the video link.
- A git repo with your code, a url to your LinkedIn article, and to your video. Don't forget to include a readme describing how to deploy it (don't include any passwords or secret keys!).

## Ideas of what to do

1. A weather monitoring system, detects anomalies and pushes alerts.
2. A cashier application that scans barcodes of products and does recommendations.
3. A home video surveillance/monitoring system.
4. A remote energy monitoring application for your house, RV, boat etc.
5. You may also consider using ChatGPT's API to make some more [intelligent application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCk4Rabkmjc).
6. A GPS system with map support for your bike/kayak/...
7. If you want you can even create a game on the M5stack (eg [Roll the ball](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roll-the-ball-slide-puzzle/id961875786), or Snake), but it should have some cloud component (e.g. storage of multi-user data, etc).
8. An interactive display for a shop, using small motors, and so on.
9. (your own idea here).

Your project should feature some type of **user interface** with which the user can interact, either on the browser (via Google Cloud/Run) or on the display of the M5Stack device.

## Deadlines

1. March 16 (at midnight): send your 1-page proposal as a pdf on Moodle (link). You should clearly write down how many sensors, devices, etc you will need for your project (the fewer the better, as we can only guarantee 1-2 devices and 1-2 sensors pro group), and also which services from Google Cloud you expect to use. Your TAs may add more elements to your project to make it more challenging!
2. April 06: Milestone 1: Show your progress during the lab (we expect you to have some parts fleshed out)
3. May 04: Milestone 2: Show your progress (we expect some connectivity with google cloud/services)
4. May 30: Final deliverable (LinkedIn article, video, github, and web address if your application is live)

## What will make your project stand out

- Originality: be creative! 
- Smart usage of the tools shown during the course 
- Functionality / ease of use: is it easy to use and understand? Does it work? Is it useful?
- High-quality / elegant code
