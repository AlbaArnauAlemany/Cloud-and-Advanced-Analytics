## Intro
Welcome to the first lab of Cloud and Advanced Analytics.

In this week, we will give you a brief overview of cloud-based services. More specifically, we will look into **Google Cloud**, one of the most popular cloud services platforms. 

ðŸ’³ <u>Please bring your credit card to the Week 1 lab or [register on your own for your Google cloud account from home before the lab using this quick guide](Week1_Google_Cloud-create_account.pdf).</u> 

* Register on Slack. This will be our main communication channel.
* Create an account on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). This needs to be a google account.
* **Note**: For the Google Cloud account, you will have to enter your credit card information, but you won't be charged. It is just to verify that you are not a bot. Upon joining, you will receive a free $300 credit valid for 3 months. See also [here](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/?modal_active=none) for classes on Google Cloud for students.
* Do some simple exercises using the cloud.

You are going to use this services all throughout the semester, so make sure that you have created your account by the end of the week. Afterwards try to explore the various features you see in Google Cloud.

**Highly recommended**: If at any point you feel lost while using this service, we encourage you to look at the documentation provided by [Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs). They teach you how to use their services, and provide numerous code examples.


## Learning Goals
* Setup of Google Cloud accounts
* Gaining familiarity with Google Cloud Console, especially billing, storage, Big Data, AI

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - Storage
* From the side menu, go to _Storage_ > _Storage_ and create a new bucket. Besides a unique name, you can keep the default configuration (but read through it anyway to see what kind of options are available to you).
* Upload a CSV from your laptop (either an existing one or one that you create for that purpose).
* Change the permissions so that the file is readable by everyone (i.e., "Public").
* Access the CSV file from your browser (private session) using the public URL.
* Remove the previously set permission.
* For further reference the [documentation is available here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public?hl=en-GB).
