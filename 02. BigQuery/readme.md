# SQL on the Cloud: Google BigQuery

This week, we will see how to use Google BigQuery more in depth and how to access it from our notebooks.

## Learning Goals

* Learn how BigQuery works (data upload and exploration)
* Strengthen SQL knowledge by querying a public dataset on BigQuery

## Lab Structure

1. Presentation of the project
2. [Review of SQL](https://github.com/michalis0/Cloud-and-Advanced-Analytics/blob/main/02.%20BigQuery/week_02_exercises_sqlite.ipynb)
3. [BigQuery walkthrough](https://github.com/michalis0/Cloud-and-Advanced-Analytics/blob/main/02.%20BigQuery/week_02_walkthrough.pdf)
4. [Exercises](https://github.com/michalis0/Cloud-and-Advanced-Analytics/blob/main/02.%20BigQuery/week_02_exercises_big_query.ipynb)

## Walkthrough

First, a [review of SQL](https://github.com/michalis0/Cloud-and-Advanced-Analytics/blob/main/02.%20BigQuery/week_02_exercises_sqlite.ipynb) will be made. Then, the walkthrough will be done directly on the Google BigQuery console, as well as on the BigQuery exercises [notebook](https://github.com/michalis0/Cloud-and-Advanced-Analytics/blob/main/02.%20BigQuery/week_02_exercises_big_query.ipynb). We have also added some [slides](https://github.com/michalis0/Cloud-and-Advanced-Analytics/blob/main/02.%20BigQuery/week_02_walkthrough.pdf) containing all the information you need to get you started in BigQuery. You can use the SQL notebook to refresh your SQL skills.
