# Cloud and Advanced Analytics

Dear Students,

Here you will find everything you need for the labs. Simply go to the corresponding week and you will find the materials.

The labs will generally always have the same basic structure:

1. Walkthroughs: The TAs will guide you through Google Cloud that explain how to practically apply concepts seen in the lectures. These notebooks will greatly help you solve the exercices and the assignment, therefore, it will only benefit you to pay close attention.
2. Exercises: You will do some exercises, either by yourselves, or in small groups
3. Solutions: Motivated students will be able to share their solution (remember, often there is an infinite number of solutions to any problem!) with the class. If no group volunteers, the TAs will present a sample solution.

Also, when the project will kick off, during the labs you will be able to ask for advice about your group project. 

If you have questions or face problems you cannot resolve during the labs, do not hesitate to ask for clarifications. If you have questions after the labs, please use the our slack channel. Also, remember that Google/ChatGPT are your friends, especially while coding!

We are looking forward to a great semester with you.

Your Cloud and Advanced Analytics TAs
