Welcome to our three-week Internet of Things (IoT) lab series! During these labs, we will delve into the fascinating world of IoT, utilizing the versatile M5 Stack devices for hands-on learning.


## Learning Goals
By the end of these labs, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic principles of IoT and its applications.
- Configure and program M5 Stack devices to interact with various sensors and actuators.
- Design and implement IoT-based solutions to solve real-world problems.
- Gain familiarity with data collection, processing, and visualization in an IoT context.
- Understand IoT security concerns and best practices to mitigate them.


## Introduction
Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly expanding field that refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. These devices collect and exchange data, allowing us to create smarter environments and systems.

M5 Stack devices are highly integrated modular development platforms for IoT applications. These devices have a unique stackable design and are packed with robust features, making them ideal for IoT development.

During these three weeks, we will explore the extensive capabilities of M5 Stack devices, understand how they can be programmed to interact with sensors and actuators, and see how they fit into the larger IoT ecosystem. We will collect and analyze data from these devices and use this data to design practical IoT solutions.


## Lab Walkthrough
Each week, we will focus on different aspects of IoT and M5 Stack devices:

- Week 3 - Introduction to IoT and M5 Stack Devices: We will cover the basics of IoT and get familiarized with the M5 Stack devices. This includes setting up the devices, understanding their features, and programming them to perform simple tasks.

- Week 4 - Sensors and Data Collection: We will delve into how M5 Stack devices interact with sensors to collect data. We will also explore how this data can be processed and used in real-world applications.

- Week 5 - Advanced IoT Applications: In the final week, we will tackle advanced IoT concepts and look at how we can connect the device to Google GCP for cloud-based data processing and visualization.

Stay tuned for a fascinating journey through the realm of IoT!
