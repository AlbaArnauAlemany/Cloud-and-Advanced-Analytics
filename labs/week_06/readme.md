In this lab, we will dive deep into the exciting world of Recommender Systems, focusing on the Surprise library and User-User Collaborative Filtering.

## Learning Goals
By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand the principles and applications of Recommender Systems.
- Be proficient in using the Surprise library to develop and deploy recommender models.
- Comprehend the concept of User-User Collaborative Filtering and how to implement it from scratch (time permitting).

## Introduction
Recommender Systems play a crucial role in today's data-driven world, especially in domains like e-commerce, media streaming, and social media platforms. These systems help provide personalized suggestions to users based on their past behavior and preferences.

During this lab, we will be using the Surprise library, a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems. Furthermore, we will explore User-User Collaborative Filtering, a common technique used in recommender systems if time allows.

## Lab Walkthrough
Throughout this lab, we will be following the [Recommender_systems](week_06_recommender_systems.ipynb) notebook. This notebook includes detailed walkthroughs of the concepts and code, as well as an exercise that we will be doing during the lab.

Note: The `__init__.py` file in the lab materials contains a class that we will need to import in the walkthrough notebook.
