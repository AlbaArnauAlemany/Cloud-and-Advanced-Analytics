Welcome to this week's lab where we will delve into Google BigQuery. We will learn to leverage this powerful tool within our notebooks and enhance our SQL knowledge.

## Learning Goals
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the functionalities and navigation of Google BigQuery
- Upload and explore data in BigQuery
- Query public datasets in BigQuery to reinforce your SQL skills

## Introduction
Google BigQuery is a highly scalable and serverless data warehouse provided by Google that allows for rapid SQL queries and data analysis. It supports the analysis of large datasets in real-time, using the robust infrastructure of Google.

BigQuery is designed to make data analysis simple and cost-effective by eliminating the need for database administration and infrastructure management. It provides a convenient interface for loading, querying, and visualizing data.

The service uses standard SQL. Its seamless integration with other Google Cloud services and data visualization tools facilitates a wide range of data science and research applications. Google BigQuery serves as a potent resource for exploring complex datasets and enabling data-driven research


## Lab Walkthrough
The walkthrough will be conducted directly on the Google BigQuery console and on the [BigQuery Exercises Notebook](week_02_exercises_big_query.ipynb). For your convenience, we have included a set of [slides](week_02_walkthrough.pdf) encapsulating all the necessary details to get started with BigQuery. Use the SQL notebook to brush up on your SQL skills.
