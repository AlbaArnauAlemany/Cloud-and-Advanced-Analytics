# Building a webapp with Flask or Streamlit

![alt text](ml_demo.png)


We will learn how to make a web application. It's a useful skill to have. You could think of building a simple website for your project, or if you have a startup idea in the future maybe!

## Plan
1. Creation of Hello World webapp with Flask
2. Walkthrough of example of ML webapp with Flask and Huggingface
3. Deploying a Flask web application on Google cloud
4. Building a webapp with Streamlit

### Part 1 - Flask
We will learn how to make a web application with flask. We will start by building a simple `HelloWorld` web application which will run locally on your computer. Then we will see how we can use HTML to shape the different pages of our web app. Furthermore, we will see how we can pass parameters to our web application. Finally, we will see how we can deploy our web application into Google cloud app engine so that it is accessible from anywhere in the Web.

To get a more in-depth knowledge of Flask, we would recommend you to watch this nice <a href="https://youtu.be/mqhxxeeTbu0">tutorial series</a> on flask.

Moreover, you can also follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbejfDTHhhg">this tutorial</a> in order to get to know more about deploying a Flask ML application on Google cloud.


### Part 2 - Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. Basically, with respect to Flask+HTML, it makes your life easier, but slightly "limits" your possibilities.
